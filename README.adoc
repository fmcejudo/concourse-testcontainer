== About the author

I am a developer working from Ryanair, an airline company in which we have freedom to practice and play with technologies.
Also a proud Spring fan and keen on practicing around the nice topics offered by Pivotal.

== About the practice

The aim of this practice is running integration test with Testcontainer and run those tests inside Concourse as CI/CD tool.

== Test Containers

I am not going to write that much about this tools or present anything around it, the web is plenty of documentation and
it says much more about what I might say. You might find it at link:

`https://www.testcontainers.org/`

But instead how use this nice tool, which let's use services
which might not be ready when we are running our tests or tests shouldn't change the state of the environment after running them.

There is a big community behind and it is not just for containers you built or relational databases, but also for AWS services
which might have an extra cost just because you want to run tests.

Also happy to say that it is not just for Java language, but other developers also might take advantage of it.

Take a look and don't miss out the opportunity to write more reliable integration tests with the third parties involved
when you are doing your convoluted application.

== Concourse

People like to take new flavours and this is one of those that is easy to take. It does not mean it is going to take over any other, but
worthy giving it a try and check how easy is start with it. It has some nuances, I think because its maturity as it was release in 2014 and sometimes might annoy,
but I can't leave it now, I don't know if this is because I work for an airline industry or because Pivotal supports it or what another reasons.

`https://concourse-ci.org/docs.html`

This is mostly flying everywhere and one of the most engaging features is that I can check its progress in the command line,
isn't it that awesome?

This builds jobs with their plans, plans made of steps, steps which are resources, and resources which are docker containers, isolated each other.
Which are given inputs and they return outputs. Resources can download your source code, build your artifact and push it to your repository and if everything is OK
then you might want to deploy it into a platform or service. Decide everything you want to do in your pipeline.

Also it is nice to say that you don't need to have many plugins installed or you don't need to run it always in the
same setup CI/CD environment, you just pop a container image, take your params, merge them into the pipeline and run
your pipeline in it. This docker image can be in your host, in your partner host or remotely in a server, as far as you
have access to the environments you defined in your pipeline it will happily run the steps for you.

== Sample Practice

Having said that and taking into consideration that as developers we like playing with new technology, we can find out there
Java 12 (OpenJDK if you  don't have a license, so do I!) what is the latest version until now and we want to use it,
but with the downside of the lack of those containers or resources in which those steps run and Testcontainers running with docker, what means
`docker in docker with Java 12 and maven 3.6+`. We can't say this is not fun.

So this practice is made of two repositories actually, one of which is creating that docker image with all that installed
to let Concourse use it in its pipeline.

We can find this repo at:

`https://github.com/fmcejudo/dcind-jdk/tree/updating_jdk_12`

and the built image at:

`framc83/dcind-jdk`

The other is this one with the source code:

`https://github.com/fmcejudo/concourse-testcontainer`

in which we can find the ci folder containing the pipeline definition.
A very simple one, which just take the source code and runs its tests.

In the source code, everything we have is a service which sends emails in a very simple way and it sends the emails when the application starts up.

In the test side, we check that emails are sent, popping up a docker image, configuring JavaMail to use this smtp server
and asserting the emails are in the server.

== Running the practice

In order to have this practice up and running, we need to have concourse installed somewhere accessible from our host, probably the simplest way
is with docker in our own machine. The steps to do so can be found at:

https://github.com/concourse/concourse-docker

Once we have concourse ready and `fly` client install in our host with the same version as the target concourse has, we are ready to kick off
our pipeline.

To have an example of concourse url, let's say that our concourse is at: `http://localhost:8070` because we have configured so.

So, firstly we have to login in a target at concourse:

`fly -t <target> login --concourse-url http://localhost:8070 -u <your_user> -p <your_password>`

If you want to inspect your targets or you want to wipe them out or you did something really bad and mess up your targets,
you always can access to you `~/.flyrc` and remove the block or blocks or even remove it.

After you connect to your remote ci tool, you might want to set up this pipeline, let's start from the root folder of the project:

`fly -t <target> set-pipeline -p <your_pipeline_name> -c ci/pipeline.yaml -l credentials.yaml`

Bare in mind that `credentials.yaml` is not pushed to the remote source repository as this might contain sensitive information about the
developer. And instead you have been given a template you need to fill out and move to the file `credentials.yaml` which is the
actual file which contains the properties which are merged into the pipeline.

Once you accept the pipeline and you check everything is what you want, then you need to unpause the pipeline. By default the pipeline is
paused. It is fine if you just go to the web and unpause the pipeline, but it is not that fun, so enjoy doing it manually with:

`fly -t <target> unpause-pipeline -p <your_pipeline_name>`

Now your pipeline will start soon, checking the source code in the git repository and pulling it into the steps to run, you will see
that in the web, but for nerds you might want to check everything in running in your target concourse and observe a particular one.

`fly -t <target> builds` showing everything what happen in concourse.

`fly -t <target> watch -j <your_pipeline_name>/integration-tests` will show the same progress as the web does,
but in your terminal.

Finally if you want to trigger again your pipeline or further on when you have more jobs and you want to trigger
from a given one, you might want to use

`fly -t <target> trigger-job -j <your_pipeline_name>/integration-tests`

When everything is ok, when you want to release resources or your pipeline is not needed or you want to change instead,
in other words you want to get rid of your pipeline, just do:

`fly -t <target> destroy-pipeline -p <your_pipeline_name>`

Also you can drop your concourse ci and when you want to come back you can pop it again without reconfigure anything,
concourse does not need it!

So, multiple benefits of running concourse as your ci, but for me the winner has been to be able to do it in my own,
no waiting for other members of the team to finish their jobs to run mine, we can have multiple concourse ci for free
and no paying the pain of configure specific plugins.

== Reviewing the outputs of the practice

Nothing super fancy has been done in here, we are not deploying to any platform, we are not caching heavy resources
for the coming up process, but we are able to run our integration tests within `Testcontainer`
which are container inside containers with `maven` and `java 12`.

So, if you see the job with the task `test_app` you will see the test passed and docker run inside.
